# General restart schemes

MATLAB code for restart schemes, *currently a work-in-progress!*

If you plan to run anything here, you should know that

- the radial restart scheme code was updated, now the NESTA and FISTA examples do not work

## Requirements

Runs on MATLAB R2020b without issue. *TO DO: list toolboxes if any are used.*

## Running the experiments

Clone or download the repository, and set the MATLAB path to be from the repository root. 
The experiments are the `ne_*.m` scripts.

## Issues

Pertaining to the code, post questions, requests, and bugs in [Issues](https://github.com/mneyrane/restart-schemes/issues).
